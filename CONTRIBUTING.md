## Code of Conduct

The goal of this resource is to help interviewees ask better questions and interviewers provide better information. The questions aim to be inclusive and be appropriate regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

What makes a good question is subjective, so be respective and communicative if people have questions. This resource absolutely does not tolerate insulting, demeaning or harassing behaving.

If you experience an issue, please email [brett@brettchalupa.com](mailto:brett@brettchalpa.com).

## Adding Questions

Add questions by editing the `README.md` question list and submitted a Pull Request. Those changes will then be reviewed and discussed and probably merged in. If the added questions fall into an existing subsection, please add them there. If there is not an existing subsection, add a new one.

Be sure to add yourself to the [Credits](https://github.com/brettchalupa/developer-interview-questions#credits) if you want to be listed.

## Suggesting Changes

If you want to discuss a question or have feedback, [open a GitHub Issue on the repository](https://github.com/brettchalupa/developer-interview-questions/issues/new).

## Style Guide

- Questions should be intentional and unassuming
- Use “organization” instead of “company”
- Write the questions as full sentences, as one could potentially say out loud
- Use non-gender specific language, like “they,” “y’all,” “you all”
- Provide examples or more context below a question in a nested bulleted list

## Translating

If you are interested in translating the questions to different languages, create a `README_#{LANGUGE_CODE}.md` with the translated questions. For example, the Japanese version would be titled `README_JP.md`.
